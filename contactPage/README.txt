A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Nikodepen/pen/EaKepa.

 Simple contact form based on a dribbble by Kerem Suer. I did not have time today to work on something unique, but I love this design. One could really do a lot with it. Clean and simple. Pushing hard on the cooking site right now though! 

Forked from [Ricky Eckhardt](http://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/)'s Pen [Contact Form - Pen a Day 20](http://codepen.io/rickyeckhardt/pen/Fxaml/).
